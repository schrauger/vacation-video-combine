ignore Unstitched folder
ignore Videos Combined.MTS file. 
ignore B-roll folder
for Stitched videos, maybe just use them as-is? they'll be warped, but still want them in videos. otherwise, I'll have to use overcapture on each clip and focus on a certain viewpoint
* also inside Stiched folder, use filename for datetime, not media creation. or run another script to set up the timestamp correctly for those files


get creation date

of those that lack creation date, use filename? or find the average timestamp of the files in the same folder (siblings).
